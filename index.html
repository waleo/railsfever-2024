        <h3 class="display-6">Fractional Software Development</h3>
        <p>
          Do you need a dedicated Ruby on Rails developer for a set number of
          weekly hours? I help small businesses fill the gap in their software
          development team. This service includes project planning, weekly
          meetings, feature development and bug fixes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-6">Rails Upgrade</h3>
        <p>
          Many companies are unable to upgrade their Rails apps regularly. I
          will upgrade you to the latest Rails version then keep you up to date
          every year.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-6">Long Term Support</h3>
        <p>
          When developers have a short term view, their work is usually low
          quality. That affects your business negatively. My goal is to work
          with you for several years. Therefore I deliver high quality
          maintainable code that will serve you and your clients for decades.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-6">Feature Development</h3>
        <p>
          No feature is too small or too big. I have the experience needed to
          build any software features quickly. Need an integration to a web
          service? Iâ€™ll build it ASAP.

      <h2 class="display-5">History</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          I've always been a tinkerer. As a child, I was known to take apart
          door handles and attempt to put them back together, with varying
          degrees of success. My parents quickly learned to hide screwdrivers
          from me!
        </p>

        <p>
          I started tinkering with computers in the early 1990s, working with
          Microsoft Disk Operating System and floopy disks. In 1999 I enrolled
          in college in New York and majored in Electrical Engineering.
