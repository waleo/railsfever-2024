        <h3 class="display-6">Fractional Software Development</h3>
        <p>
          Do you need a dedicated Ruby on Rails developer for a set number of
          weekly hours? I help small businesses fill the gap in their software
          development team. This service includes project planning, weekly
          meetings, feature development and bug fixes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-6">Rails Upgrade</h3>
        <p>
          Many companies are unable to upgrade their Rails apps regularly. I
          will upgrade you to the latest Rails version then keep you up to date
          every year.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-6">Long Term Support</h3>
        <p>
          When developers have a short term view, their work is usually low
          quality. That affects your business negatively. My goal is to work
          with you for several years. Therefore I deliver high quality
          maintainable code that will serve you and your clients for decades.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-6">Feature Development</h3>
        <p>
          No feature is too small or too big. I have the experience needed to
          build any software features quickly. Need an integration to a web
          service? Iâ€™ll build it ASAP.

      <h2 class="display-5">History</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          I've always been a tinkerer. As a child, I was known to take apart
          door handles and attempt to put them back together, with varying
          degrees of success. My parents quickly learned to hide screwdrivers
          from me!
        </p>

        <p>
          I started tinkering with computers in the early 1990s, working with
          Microsoft Disk Operating System and floopy disks. During college I was
          invited to join a NASA program where I worked with Climate Scientist
          Jim Hansen, Gavin Schmidt and others. I learned the FORTRAN
          programming language which I applied to building climate models and
          supporting research.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2004 I graduated from the City University of New York with an
          Electrical Engineering degree. I started working at Micromuse as a
          Quality Assurance Engineer. I learned a lot about UNIX and Linux
          system administration, and managing databases. I later moved to IBM
          where I worked as a Test Automation Engineer using Perl and Java
          programming languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          By 2010 I was a lead software engineer for various development teams.
          By 2014 I had decided that working Independently was my best move
          personally and professionally. I learned the Ruby programming language
          and was infected with Rails Fever, a highly contagious paradigm shift
          in how to build modern web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Principal Developer at Rails Fever, I've had the priviledge to work
          with several SaaS companies that need a reliable Engineer to handle
          their technical needs. I enjoy being challenged with the next
          frontier, making the impossible a reality and playing a small but
          critical part in the success of your business.

      <h2 class="display-5">Frequently Asked Questions?</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>How big is your team?</h3>

        <p>
          In order to provide high quality and profesional level service, I
          personallyhandle Ruby on Rails software development for my clients. I
          am connected to a network of experts that I bring on sometimes to
          assist with special projects.
        </p>

        <h3>How much do you charge?</h3>

        <p>
          There are many factors that influence my pricing. A more important
          question is what is my price value ratio? This number cannot be
          quantified, it can only be experienced. A good way to experience this
          is by working on a trial project together. Why not
          <b>email me at hello@railsfever.com</b> so we can define what this
          looks like for your company?
        </p>

        <h3>I'm concerned you won't have enough time for my project</h3>

        <p>
          This is a valid concern, most of my clients have experienced
          availability and reliability issues with their developers / agencies.
          You won't experience this while working with me. I schedule your
          project to ensure that you will get the best possible availability to
          meet your needs.
