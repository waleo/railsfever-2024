      <h2>About</h2>

      <h2>Services</h2>
      <br />
      <section>
        <h3>Fractional Software Development</h3>
        <p>
          Do you need a dedicated Ruby on Rails developer for a set number of
          weekly hours?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm available to fill the gap in your software development team. This
          service includes project planning, weekly meetings, feature
          development and bug fixes.
        </p>

        <h3>Rails Upgrade</h3>
        <p>
          Are you several versions behind the current Rails version? Would you
          like a reliable expert to help upgrade your system without crippling
          your business?
        </p>

        <p>
          Your old Rails app may appear to be working fine on the surface, but
          beneath that it is suffering from security vulnerabilities, and is
          unmaintainable. This will eventually affect your business negatively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reach out to discuss how I can upgrade you to the latest Rails version
          then keep you up to date every year.
        </p>

        <h3>Long Term Support</h3>
        <p>
          Your application slows to a grind over several weeks. Suddenly users
          are unable to save a page. Connections to a 3rd party service are
          start failing. Users cannot make payments.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are just a few examples of issues you may experience with your
          SaaS business. Do you have someone responsible, reliable and
          intelligent enough to handle such crisis? Better yet do you have
          someone experienced enough to prevent your system from experiencing a
          crisis?
        </p>

        <p>
          If you answered no to any of those questions, book a meeting with me
          ASAP to discuss how to protect your business.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rails Fever LLC came at a time we needed an immediate intervention due
          to a connectivity failure in our custom-designed platform. We needed a
          swift diagnosis and solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rails Fever (Wale and his team) delivered! They were prompt,
          competent, professional, accurate in their assessment and effective in
          their strategy, as well as reasonably priced. I would hire them again!
        </p>

        <p>
          - <i><b>Julie - Creator and Owner - Brave Writer</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Wale is a wise, kind, and excellent software developer who brings
          maturity to a team. He pushes for communication where it's lacking,
          does the work that needs to be done, and I'm glad to have worked with
          him for the last three years.
        </p>

        <p>
          - <i><b>Jimmy - CTO/Partner - SuperCat Solutions</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Wale consults with us at FloorsUSA.com to manage software development
          for our custom Ruby on Rails E-commerce platform. Given that we sell
          over 100,000 rugs on the site, the architecture and data management is
          quite complex and demanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wale is a very talented Web developer who combines technical know-how
          with excellent organizational skills. He completes complicated tasks
          quickly and with minimal oversight, which is excellent for our small
          team.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of his efficiency, Wale has successfully managed ongoing
          technical operations and software development affordably and
          predictably. On a personal level, Wale is a straight shooter,
          trustworthy and very pleasant to work with. I highly recommend him to
          any client.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <i><b>Yis Tigay - Founder & CEO - Synema</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Wale took our software production process to a level that might never
          have been reached without him. He provided a constant open stream of
          communication between product owners and the development team that
          pushed our productivity forward and eliminated considerable prep work.
        </p>

        <p>
          At our small startup Wale balanced managing our sprint and release
          flow to contributing as a Rails developer and improving our company
          strategy. He is the complete package.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <i><b>Lindsay Obar - Head of Sales - Blake Hill Preserves</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked with Wale for several months managing software for a large
          client. I have seen him apply his strong technical and business sense
          to tackle software design problems and build great solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He can manage the full stack, from fixing server issues on AWS, to
          writing great Ruby code, to dealing with front-end issues, I know I
          can trust Wale as a strong technical partner.
        </p>

          <i><b>Benjamin Greenberg - Platform Architect - Sonos Inc</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not a developer, but worked with Wale as a product team member for
          Subtext Media. What impressed me most about Wale was his ability to
          ask the right question at the right time -- a question that got right
          to the heart of the decision we faced or the idea we were discussing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has that rare and invaluable ability to step back from a discussion
          and see it from a perspective that others are missing. And he
          communicates well with those of us who don't share his technical
          background, which makes him a great liaison between the technical and
          non-technical realms.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <i><b>Mark Travis - Product Owner - Subtext Media</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>Wale is an exceptional communicator and coach.</p>
        <p>
          He is able to inspire transformation in team culture and draw out the
          best in each developer and the development team as a wholeâ€”using open
          and honest dialog, and drawing from his deep practical knowledge of
          many different development methodologies, informed by his significant
          experience as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are serious about getting the most out of your developers, hire
          Wale immediately!
        </p>

        <p>
          I had the honor to work with Wale at Subtext Media, where he helped to
          guide our team by taking the lead on project management tasks while
          simultaneously contributing as a Rails developer.
        </p>

        <p>Wale is a critical thinker who asks important questions.</p>
        <p>
          During Wale's tenure, our team greatly improved its capacity for
          deliveries, established a reliable process for story point estimating,
          underwent a site-wide redesign, migrated to an entirely new database
          schema and countless other features and enhancements.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will miss working with Wale recommend him to any engineering team.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          I've always been a tinkerer. As a child, I was known to take apart
          door handles and attempt to put them back together, with varying
          degrees of success. My parents quickly learned to hide screwdrivers
          from me!
        </p>

        <p>
          I started tinkering with computers in the early 1990s, working with
          Microsoft Disk Operating System and floppy disks. During college I was
          invited to join a <b>NASA</b> program where I worked with Climate
          Scientist Jim Hansen, Gavin Schmidt and others. I learned the FORTRAN
          programming language which I applied to building climate models and
          supporting research.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2004 I graduated from the City University of New York with an
          <b>Electrical Engineering</b> degree. I started working at Micromuse
          as a Quality Assurance Engineer. I learned a lot about UNIX system
          administration and managing databases. I later joined
          <b>IBM</b>
          where I worked as a Test Automation Engineer using Perl and Java
          programming languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          By 2010 I has gained experience as lead software engineer for various
          development teams. In 2013 I decided that working Independently was my
          best move personally and professionally. I learned the Ruby
          programming language and was infected with <b>Rails Fever</b> - a
          highly contagious paradigm shift in how to build modern web
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Principal, Sales lead, Accountant, Bookkeeper and Chief Cook at
          Rails Fever, I've had the privilege of working with several SaaS
          companies that need a reliable Engineer to handle their technical
          needs. I enjoy being challenged, making the impossible a reality and
          playing a small but critical part in the success of your business.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions?</h2>
      <section>
        <br />
        <h3>How big is your team?</h3>

        <p>
          In order to provide high quality and professional level service, I
          personally handle Ruby on Rails software development for my clients. I
          am connected to a network of experts that can assist as needed with
          special projects.
        </p>

        <h3>How much do you charge?</h3>

        <p>
          There are many factors that influence my pricing. A more important
          question is what is my price value ratio? This number cannot be
          quantified, it can only be experienced. A good way to experience this
          is by working on a trial project together. Why not
          <b>email me at hello@railsfever.com</b> so we can define what this
          looks like for your company?
        </p>

        <h3>I'm concerned you won't have enough time for my project</h3>

        <p>
          This is a valid concern, most of my clients have experienced
          availability and reliability issues with their developers / agencies.
          You won't experience this with me. I will schedule your project to
          ensure that I provide predictable availability.
